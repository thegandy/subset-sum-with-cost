#### Subset sum with cost problem
**Problem statement:**
Given a set of objects containing non-negative integer value and cost, and a value of sum, find a subset of the given set of objects with sum of values equal to given sum and minimizing sum of cost values.
**Solution:**
This algorithm gives us solution to this problem in polynomial time O(n*sum) where n is size of set.
